# Ridge and Lasso Regression Tutorial

## Overview
Welcome to this comprehensive Jupyter Notebook tutorial on Ridge and Lasso regression! This tutorial explains the concepts of Ridge and Lasso regression, implements them from scratch using Python and NumPy, and contrasts their performance on synthetic 2-D data. 

### Ridge Regression
- Performs L2 regularization, adding penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients.
- Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of square of coefficients)

### Lasso Regression
- Performs L1 regularization, adding penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients.
- Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of the absolute value of coefficients)

Here, LS Obj refers to the ‘least squares objective,’ i.e., the linear regression objective without regularization.
